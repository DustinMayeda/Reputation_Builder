Business Understanding

Are you interested in becoming a software developer or a data scientist?  Did you just graduate college or decide to make a career change and are worried about your lack of experience in software development or data analytics?  You could go back to school to get your masters or Ph.D. in machine learning to learn the intricacies of neural networks or in computational complexity to study the P vs NP problem and understand why the halting problem is unsolvable.  But, ain’t nobody got time for that!  There’s life to live, bills to pay, and a job to be had.  However, the question remains:  How can you demonstrate your knowledge, skill, and community spirit to employers?  Well, Stack Overflow and Cross Validated are sites that provide an ample opportunity to boost your reputation by answering questions.  Now, you’re probably asking yourself just how do I know if it is worth my time to answer a particular question?  With The Reputation Builder you’ll never have to wonder about that again.  The Reputation Builder is a predictive data analytics model which will take in a forum question and give you a prediction on how much reputation you stand to gain if you give the top or an average answer.  In no time your reputation will skyrocket and you’ll be hired.
